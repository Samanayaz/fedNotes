    <p>
                 Everyone loves a good deal and many people rarely buy anything full price. But with that comes the addiction to the sale. You end up coming up with great buys, but things you don’t really need. Have you ever you heard <em> “It’s a steal! It’s on sale, you should buy it!” </em> out of your head whenever you find a sign of 60% off in large letttering outside your favorite store. Sometimes you can actually score big, and other times you spend your whole budget on sale pieces you never get to use. I would like to put together some suggestions for shopping sales and how to get a great deal.

        <h3>Would you buy</h3>
        <p>
            Were you eyeing it before it went on sale? If so, it’s probably a good idea to snag it now when it’s actually is marked down. If it’s something you are buying just because its really cheap, but you wouldn’t have bought it full price, then leave it out of your cart. If you’re on the fence, go ahead and say no. I always tell people if you don’t LOVE it, don’t buy it. There are way too many things out there to just be "so-so"with purchases.

        <h3>Does it fit right?</h3>
        <p>
                Don’t sacrifice fit for the sale tag. It happens many times that you end up buying something a little big or small just because it was on sale and it never fit comfortably so you may never endup wearing it. Shoes, tops, jeans. ALL of it. Don’t sacrifice comfort. Save your money and buy the jeans that give to true shape and the shoes that won’t slide.

        <h3> Will it stay in trend next year?</h3>
        <p>
                Most of the time, things get marked down because they are about to bring out new items and seasonal clothing. Is what you’re about to purchase going to be in style next winter or is it a trend that won’t likely be around again. Staples, basics, and timeless pieces are always a good bet, but leave the trendy pieces and “out there” looks on the rack.

        <h3>what's in my cart for a while?</h3>
        <p>
                sometimes you have pieces already in mind that you like, but aren’t willing to splurge on. When those go on sale, absolutely go for it. There are some high dollar items that I have my eye on, and I usually wait for them to go on sale before I pull the trigger. Almost everything has sales around the year. Know the store and what they usually offer, and be ready when they mark the price down of your favorite item.

        <h3>Do I really love it?</h3>
        <p>
                It's possible that some influencer might say "you need it", or your best friend has it in dark tone already, but if it’s not your esthetics or doesn’t fit your lifestyle, it isn’t even worth the sale price. Follow your gut and your go-to’s. Sometimes it is good to break outside the box when it comes to fashion, but overall, you know if you are truly going to wear it or not.
